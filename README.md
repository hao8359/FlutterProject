## Abstract

Each year, an average of 700 patients are diagnosed with throat cancer in Taiwan. For those who undergo vocal cord removal surgery, speaking becomes difficult and uncomfortable. Therefore, a voice assistant device becomes crucial. Additionally, most throat cancer patients in Taiwan are aged between 50-70, making Taiwanese a widely spoken language. However, there is currently no voice assistant app in Taiwanese. This app assists users with no vocal cords or speech difficulties to speak through their phones, allowing them to quickly respond using shortcuts, manually type for immediate responses, and use floating buttons for alert signals to facilitate care.
